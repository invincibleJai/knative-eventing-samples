# Source to Service 

One of the simplest uses cases of Knative eventing is to directly sink the events from the emitting source to a Knative Serving Service (`ksvc`).

## Deploy the consuming Knative Serving Service

The first step is the deployment of a Knative Serving service that later acts as the consumer of the events, emitted by the _Knative Eventing Source_:

```
k apply -f 000-ksvc.yaml
```

The above installs a new `ksvc`, called _service-one_, to the `default` namespace. After applying the file, we can check some details about our new `ksvc`, by running ` k get ksvc`:

```
NAME               URL                                           LATESTCREATED            LATESTREADY              READY   REASON
service-one   http://service-one.default.example.com   service-one-kfhpm   service-one-kfhpm   True
```

We now have a `ksvc` running in the background, waiting for some incoming HTTP requests.

## Connect the Source to the `ksvc`

To be able to have the `ksvc` consume events, we need to hook it up to a _Knative Eventing Source_. In our tutorial we are using the `ApiServerSource`, which will allows an integration of the Kubernetes API server events into Knative.

### ServiceAccount to run the `ApiServerSource`

Before we can apply the `ApiServerSource` itself, we need to create a `ServiceAccount` that the `ApiServerSource` runs as, since it does require some permissions in order to work with the Kubernetes API server events:

```
k apply -f 010-serviceaccount.yaml
```

### Kubernetes API server events

With the `ServiceAccount` in place we can finally connect our `ApiServerSource` to the `ksvc` so it can consume events. Let's take a look at the file:

```yaml
apiVersion: sources.knative.dev/v1alpha1
kind: ApiServerSource
metadata:
  name: testevents
  namespace: default
spec:
  serviceAccountName: events-sa
  mode: Resource
  resources:
  - apiVersion: v1
    kind: Event
  sink:
    apiVersion: serving.knative.dev/v1alpha1
    kind: Service
    name: service-one
```

The `spec` of the `ApiServerSource` is referencing the previously created `ServiceAccount`, but more importantly, the `sink` part does reference our `service-one` instance of the initially installed `ksvc`.

Now let's apply it:

```
k apply -f 020-k8s-events.yaml
```

We will now see that a new pod is up and running, representing the `ApiServerSource`, when we run `k get pods`:

```
NAME                                                              READY   STATUS    RESTARTS   AGE
apiserversource-testevents-91f06d1f-cfe6-11e9-9d67-70c21b48r9pt   1/1     Running   0          86m
service-one-kfhpm-deployment-747c97d7c5-x6hnl                    2/2     Running   0          85s
```

The `apiserversource` pod is now running the `ApiServerSource`, which directly sends its events to the hardwired `ksvc`, our `service-one` installation.

> NOTE: To retrieve an overview of all source that are currently deployed in your namespace, just run `k get sources`. In our case you get the following output:
>```
>NAME                                                      AGE
>apiserversource.sources.knative.dev/testevents   5m
>```

## Show the consumed events

Finally we can now see the consumed Kubernetes API server events in the log of the `service-one-kfhpm-deployment-747c97d7c5-x6hnl` pod, by running:

```
k logs -f service-one-kfhpm-deployment-747c97d7c5-x6hnl -c user-container
```

The pod does run two containers, but we are only interested in the `user-container`, running our application via Knative Serving. In the log we now see some Kubernetes API server events, wrapped as CloudEvents:

## Conclusion 

We now have seen that one can simply consume events using a _Knative Eventing Source_ that is directly wired to a Knative Serving Service.

While this use-case is simple and easy to implement, it has some limitations, that the _Knative Eventing Source_ is not able to distribute its events to multiple consumers.
